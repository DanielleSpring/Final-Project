## **Selected Topic - The Sunshine List - is it still relavent?**

### Overview:
The Sunshine list is annual list includes public sector employees in Ontario who earned over $100,000 last year. The list is mandated by the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act enacted by the Ontario government under Mike Harris, with the first list released in 1996.


### Objective:
By analyzing public sector incomes for those employees who earned over $100,000 annually from 1996 to 2020.   The list does not denote gender or age, we will predict gender and age 

## **Questions We Would Like to Answer:**
Given the data available, can we expect housing prices to increase or decrease in the coming years?

*Using demographic, income, housing price, job industries, and rent/buy ratios in a city to help come to this prediction.
For a given city, which other US cities have similar housing and demographic data?

*For example, if a person is working in the tech sector and is looking for a new city to move to, they will be able to see a list of cities similar to San Francisco or Austin that may not be as obvious.
Given a city name, what pertinent information should be understood by someone looking to move to the area?

*Our dashboard would allow a user to see charts of demographic data, income data, housing prices, crime, and unemployment rates, and trends over time for each city.

## **Data Exploration Phase:**

## **Data Analysis Phase:**
Detailed descriptions of our data analysis can be found in our presentation.



## **Data Sources:**



## **Database:**
For our database, we will be using PostgreSQL by use of pgAdmin and we are also hosting our raw data in an AWS S3 bucket. This enables anyone with the access codes to work the project data. The image below represents the tables of data that are uploaded onto the database in Postgres. The entity relational diagram allowed for easier joining of tables with SQL and was a helpful reference while importing data into the database. There are three main tables with data that were used to build and perform the machine learning model.


## **Machine Learning:**
### Preliminary Data Processing:


### Initial Classification using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK):


### Splitting Data Into Testing & Training sets:

### Explanation of Model Choice (Including Limitations & Benefits):


## **Dashboard:**
We used Tableau to create and host our dashboard. It will be directly tied to our Postgres database hosted on AWS via a direct connection.

Our dashboard can be found here, or embedded on this website we have created to present our final project.
