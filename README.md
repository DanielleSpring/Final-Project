## Communication Protocol:

## **Selected Topic - The Sunshine List - is it still relavent?**

### Overview:
The Sunshine list is annual list includes public sector employees in Ontario who earned over $100,000 last year. The list is mandated by the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act enacted by the Ontario government under Mike Harris, with the first list released in 1996.


### Objective:
By analyzing public sector incomes for those employees who earned over $100,000 annually from 1996 to 2020.   The list does not denote gender or age, we will predict gender and age 

## **Questions We Would Like to Answer:**
Given the data available, can we use 25 years of data to determine whether the Ontario Sunshine list is still relevant? 

-Can we identify gender using first name? 
-Can we identify a person’s age based on first name or postition?
-How do civil servant salaries trend against Ontario private sector?
-Is there Gender Inequality in Ontario’s Sunshine list?  
-Does age play a factor? Is region a factor?
-Are civil servant salaries keeping up with inflation?
-How do civil servant salaries trend against Ontario private sector?
-Can raises, salary increases be track? Are they in proportion with inflation? who is getting raises? 
-When creating ranges for salaries which sectors are highest in pay and which are lowest?
-Which job titles are paid higher salary/lowest? 
-When comparing job titles in certain sectors to others are they fairly equivalent or are certain sectors more generous?
-How do people feel about the Sunshine list?
-Can we analyze public sentiment concerning the sunshine list?

## **Data Analysis Phase:**
Detailed descriptions of our data analysis can be found in our presentation.



## **Data Sources:**



## **Database:**
For our database, we will be using PostgreSQL by use of pgAdmin and we are also hosting our raw data in an AWS S3 bucket. This enables anyone with the access codes to work the project data. The image below represents the tables of data that are uploaded onto the database in Postgres. The entity relational diagram allowed for easier joining of tables with SQL and was a helpful reference while importing data into the database. There are three main tables with data that were used to build and perform the machine learning model.


## **Machine Learning:**
### Preliminary Data Processing:


### Initial Classification using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK):


### Splitting Data Into Testing & Training sets:

### Explanation of Model Choice (Including Limitations & Benefits):


## **Dashboard:**
We used Tableau to create and host our dashboard. It will be directly tied to our Postgres database hosted on AWS via a direct connection.

Our dashboard can be found here, or embedded on this website we have created to present our final project.
